  <p>
 Casey's focus on the spiritual and physical aspects of yoga, 
 with an emphasis on mindful and intelligent vinyasa sequencing,
 make her classes creative, challenging, and genuinely fun. 
 Her down-to-earth demeanor and sense of humor enable her 
 students to invigorate both the physical and subtle bodies, 
 and ignite a true passion from within. Casey's favorite part about her 
 teaching, aside from seeing bodies transforming with the breath, is witnessing
 her students develop confidence and pride for their practice. </br> </br>
Casey spent a majority of her early years as a dancer, both as a 
teacher and a performer. She graduated from the University of Kansas, 
where she was on the Dance Team, and later spent seven years teaching for the
 Universal Dance Association. She served as a choreographer and judge for the
 ESPN National Dance Team Championships, and performed with New York's Off 
 Center Dance Theatre in addition to various other choreographers and dance companies. </br> </br>
A knee injury lead Casey to yoga and quickly the practice became her passion. 
Casey started her yoga career as a Senior Teacher at Be Yoga/Yogaworks in NYC, 
where she completed the 500-hour training under the direction of Alan Finger. 
She has also completed her Advanced Teacher Training with Lois Nesbitt in Anusara 
Yoga and the Saraswati Yoga Joint Training. Little unknown facts: Self magazine 
called on Casey to be the 'yoga expert' for celebrity Julie Bowen's photoshoot! </p>
